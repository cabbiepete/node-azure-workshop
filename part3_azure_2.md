# Deploying node.js applications to Windows Azure Websites

## What are Azure Websites
A website is an application container in Windows Azure for running your code. The way it works is you create a website and then deploy your application to it. Windows Azure then takes care of hosting your app in the cloud, allowing it to scale, etc.
 
Azure Websites have some really nice benefits for node development

* Cheap - 10 free sites out of the box
* Fast - Deploy really quickly using git, github, mercurial, dropbox or FTP!
* Great for node
	* Fully supports hosting node apps
	* Downloads npm packages on the fly
	* Streaming of node ooutput logs
